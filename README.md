# Overview

I like Firefox's PIP video feature, but was annoyed that there was no way to toggle the "always on
top" property of the PIP window. After doing some searching I didn't really see any utilities that
could easily, and without a lot of pomp and circumstance, toggle this property for any aribtrary
window.

The goal of this project is to use Swift to build an app that can run as a menubar item that, when
clicked, will toggle the "always on top" property of the currently active window.
